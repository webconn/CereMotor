=========

Robot chassis control board project

CereMotor is robot chassis control board based on STM32 ARM microcontroller, made by DIMRobotics team.
This board is used in our robots, but now is under development.

This repository includes firmware sources for this project.

In final release, we will remove some legacy code and include full HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)
and frequently used algorythms.
